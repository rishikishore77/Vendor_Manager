Our company needs a vendor management system. Vendors are employees hired from different vending company. I need to create a website for this. There needs to be vendor, manager and admin users to login.
The company can have many sites.
Every site have an admin.
A site have many managers managing many vendors.
The vendor view should be as follows:
-> Login
-> Reset password option
-> Show current day's status , pending if not updated, under review if manager have not approved.
-> mark attendance (In office full day, Office half + work from home half, office half + leave half, work from home full).
-> Mark attendance only on working days (Holidays and weekends automarked as holiday, admin needs to update holiday for the year).
-> If manager rejects, it should show rejection reason (manager update the reason), employee update again.
-> View History (Calendar view) Shows the status of each day (office full day, Office half + work from home half, office half + leave half, work from home full, holiday).
-> Show current month and current year leave and Work From Home applied numbers.
-> Once admin update the work from home data, time off data and Attendance swipe data of the month (after every month), vendor needs to get mismatch table if the status entered by vendor conflicts with attendance / work from home data.
 - If vendor enter in office full day, then attendance swipe data should be present for more than 4 hrs.
 - If vendor enter in Office half + work from home half, then attendance swipe data should be present and work from home entry should be present (no need to check hours).
 - If vendor enter in office half + leave half, then attendance swipe data should be present and leave data should be present in time off data.
 - If vendor enter work from home full, then work from home entry should be present.
 - If vendor enters leave full day, entry should be present in time off data.
-> Vendor can update reason for mismatch in the table. Manager sees the table, can view reason and make final decision.
-> Only manager mark final status of mismatch entry after reading the mismatch reason.
-> Vendor can mark the current day status as well as future day's full day leave. (Only allow future full day leave have option to update advance)
The Manager view will be as follows:
-> Login
-> Reset password
-> View the data of managed teams seperately. (Manager can manage multiple teams).
-> Manager of the vendor approves his daily status.
-> Manager needs to see the status to be approved.
-> Manager rejects, need to give rejection reason. It will go back to pending state for employee to update again.
-> Manager have the control to update the data vendor in his team. (Manager can modify the data).
-> Manager needs to see pending update status of vendors.
-> Manager needs to see previous audit history by admin,
-> Manager needs to get mismatch table.
-> Manager can see if vendor update the mismatch reason or is pending to be updated by vendor.
-> Manager can update final status in case of conflict also after reading the comments. (Should be able to update even if no comments from Vendor).
-> Manager needs to see update of all vendors under him in any date. (Give a filter option based on his teams, name, work days, vendor company, date range etc).
->After every month, manager needs to make sure all the mismatches are resolved. Then mark as ready for audit for admin.
-> After this indication, admin can audit for those employees for that month.
The admin view is as follows:
-> Login
-> Each site have an admin.
-> Admin can add manager, vendor, manager vendor mapping.
-> Admin adds master data of employee like vending company etc
-> Admin can remove manager, vendor when they leave. (But their history needs to be there in database, maybe in database, can mark it as not active member)
-> Admin should be able to see all data of the vendors in his site. Admin needs a filter to view data based on vending company,  leave data, working hours, date range, manager, team etc.
-> Admin needs to export data for billing purpose of vendors.
-> This data is exported at start of a month for previous month.
-> At this time, audit ready may not be indicated by manager as employee may not have updated all or there may be mismatch.
-> In such case, consider the status not entered fields as absent (leave), mismatch fields use data entered by employee.
-> Once audit ready, the data will be proper.
-> Now if export for billing happenned before audit, compare that with audit ready data and calculate the work days difference.
-> This difference should be offseted in next month billing export.
-> So any month billing export shows the number of work days (can be before audit ready) + offset correction of previous month to show final work days.
-> Admin uploads work from home data, time off data and attendance swipe data at start of a month for the previous month.
-> This needs to be uploaded as exel with a specified format.
-> Admin have provision to set holidays for the year. (Mark in calendar or need a way to upload the data at an instance from a file)
-> Allow admin to export data only if holiday updated for that year.
-> If attendance swipe data atimeoff data, work from home data not available, use the data entered by vendor plus the available data (attencance/ wfh data) for mismatch calculation. Use data entered by vendor only and no mismatch if there is no attencance/ wfh data to upload. Some sites may not have attendance swipe data / wfh data. So take the data entered in website only.
